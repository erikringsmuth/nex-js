<h3>Unit Testing</h3>

<p>You can test with the framework of your choice. This site's test are written using BDD which is a subset of TDD that focuses on writing specs anyone can understand. The developer and business partner work together writing the specs. They describe a thing (view, button, drop-down, etc.) and state what it should do (how it responds to a click, selection, etc.). The developer then writes the expectations (like assertions) that test the technical aspect of how it works.</p>

<p>The nex-js website's <a href="tests/SpecRunner.html">Jasmine Spec Runner</a> is run below. You can see how they're written in the nex-js gh-pages branch <a href="https://github.com/erikringsmuth/nex-js/tree/gh-pages/tests">tests folder</a>.</p>
